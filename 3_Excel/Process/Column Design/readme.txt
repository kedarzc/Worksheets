I	SETUP
*************

Place the Barsched.xlt and Shape99.xlt files in the TEMPLATES folder in the
folder in which you installed Microsoft Office or Microsoft Excel. These files
MUST NOT be renamed.

This spreadsheet has been formatted using Arial, Arial Black, Tahoma and
Tekton~n TrueType fonts. The font file Tekton~n.ttf should be installed in your
\Windows\Fonts directory. Execute the ARIALB32.EXE file to install the Arial
Black font.

This spreadsheet has been optimised for a screen resolution of 1024x768 HiColor
16 bit) using large fonts. Right click on the main Windows desktop, click on
Properties and go to Settings to adjust (or see Screen Resolution below).

Sheet Tabs should be enabled. Go to Tools > Options > View

Remember!	(1) Copy the Tekton~n.ttf file into your \Windows\Fonts folder.
		(2) Run the ARIALB32.EXE file to install.
		(3) If you are using 256 colour, change to Hicolor (16 bit).


SCREEN RESOLUTION
Although this spreadsheet has been optimised and thoroughly tested out on a
resolution of 1024x768 using large fonts, it has also been tested using other
combinations of 1024x768, 800x600, large fonts and small fonts. If you wish to
use a combination other than the 1024x768 with large fonts, you may want to
adjust Excel's display. Go to View menu > Zoom and adjust. Then save the
spreadsheet (see Customisation on saving). Alternatively, use the ADJUST DISPLAY
on the SETUP sheet.

TO INSTALL THE TEKTON~N.TTF FONT FILE
------------------------------------
1) Copy Tekton~n.ttf into your /Windows/Fonts folder.
2) Go to MY COMPUTER > CONTROL PANEL and double click on FONTS.

Your font will then be installed.


II	GETTING STARTED
***********************

To use Bar Schedule, open up Excel and click on the FILE menu and then on NEW.
Bar Schedule will be displayed under the general tab with the name Barsched.xlt.
Click on Barsched.xlt and then on OK. Follow the same procedure to open Shape 99
which will be displayed under the name Shape99.xlt.

Barsched.xlt is a TEMPLATE file. When the above procedure is followed a COPY is
opened in Excel. Excel automatically generates a numerically incremented file
name for this copy (e.g. Barsched1.xls). If you want to save this copy click on
SAVE under the FILE menu. Copies will be saved in your default file location,
normally C:\My Documents. Go to TOOLS > OPTIONS > GENERAL and check.

Alternatively, to save your work in a Bar Schedule data file (default name:
bardata.xls) click on the SAVE button which is on the schedule sheet. The
bardata.xls file is a much smaller file and is suitable for emailing.

To import a previously stored data file use the OPEN button on the schedule sheet.
Do not use the Open command on the toolbar or under the FILE menu.

CUSTOMISATION
To customise Bar Schedule (e.g. Company name or Zoom settings) you must use the
SAVE button in the ADJUST DISPLAY box on the SETUP sheet.


III	SPREADSHEET INFORMATION
*******************************

Bar Schedule for Excel 97 is a spreadsheet for the scheduling of steel for the
reinforcement of concrete. The spreadsheet has been developed to comply with
BS 4466 : 1989 and Amendment No. 1 published 28 February 1990. Excel 97 refers
to Microsoft Excel 97 (v8.0) spreadsheet program which is available either
separate or as part of Microsoft Office 97.

The aim of the spreadsheet is to reduce the time taken to produce a bar
schedule, reduce arithmetical errors, reduce scheduling errors, increase
compliance with the BSI specified format for bar scheduling and facilitate
electronic data interchange.

OPERATION.
The basic operation of the spreadsheet is that the user has to clear the
coloured cells. On commencement of entering data, cells will appear coloured
blue or red. Blue cells indicate input required and red cells indicate invalid
data. Entering data into blue cells will clear the blue colour. Clearing the
contents of a red cell will clear the red colour. When there are no colours in
the row of a bar mark, then that barmark has been completed.

WHAT CAN BAR SCHEDULE DO?
Bar Schedule automatically calculates the total length of a bar in accordance
with BS 4466. Also, the total numbers of bars for each bar mark is calculated.

In addition, bar schedule will:

1)	Check the minimum bend length.
2)	Check the minimum length between two bends.
3)	Check the minimum length of a crank.
4)	Check the minimum dimensions of a link (shape codes 61 & 79).
5)	Check the minimum radius of a non-standard bend.
6)	Check the minimum offset dimension of a cranked bar.
7)	Indicate if the total length of a bar exceeds 12m.
8)	Indicate if the total length of a bar exceeds 18m.
9)	Check that input dimensions are in multiples of 5mm.
10)	Indicate dimensions required for a given shape code.
11)	Indicate dimensions placed into incorrect cells for a given shape code.
12)	Check bar type, diameter and shape code are in accordance with BS 4466.
13)	Check that numeric data only is entered into numbers off and dimensions.
14)	Comprehensive weight schedule.
15)	Allow a database of job details to be maintained.
16)	Check the bar schedule reference & bar marks are in the correct format.
17)	Allow bar types R, T, S and X to be scheduled.
18)	Check the minimum dimension of a semi-circular bend.
19)	Check the maximum pitch of a helix (shape code 87).
20)	Check if bending angles exceed 45 degrees.
21)	Indicate non-preferred bar diameters.
22)	Unlimited multiple sheets facility.
23)	Export schedules to an Excel Workbook for emailing or data storage.
24)	Import previously stored schedule data files.
25)	Export to SteelPac's SDI format (electronic data interchange).
26)	... and other features!

SHAPE CODE 99
Bar Schedule is accompanied by a second spreadsheet called Shape 99. With Shape 99
you can produce a continuation sheet with a dimensioned sketch of your bar shape.
Go to File menu, click on New and open Shape99.xlt.
